# DOM-Driven-Task-Dashboard

Built a professional, responsive Task Dashboard using vanilla JavaScript and direct DOM manipulation—no frameworks. The app will let users add, edit, delete, reorder, and filter tasks. It will also persist data in localStorage, support light/dark themes, and include smooth CSS transitions and accessible markup.

Task CRUD: Create, read, update (inline editing), delete tasks.

Drag‑and‑Drop Reordering: Use the Drag and Drop API to reorder tasks.

Filtering & Sorting: Filter by status (All, Active, Completed) and sort by due date or priority.

Theme Switcher: Toggle light/dark with smooth CSS transitions; remember choice in localStorage.

Responsive Design: Adapt to mobile & desktop; modern card/grid style.

Accessible UI: ARIA labels, keyboard support (e.g., focus outlines, Enter/Escape handling in modals).
